Planning
I began with the user authentication and communicating with the poses table in the API. This is the basic building block for all yoga classes, and teachers can make a list of interesting peak poses that they want to use. Teachers can log the muscle action for poses and cues they want to use in class.

Future versions
- create link between users and poses to sequences
- connect to the Spotify API to integrate playlists for class with sequences

Development Process
One area in which I pushed myself in this project was DOM traversal and working with elements that are rendered through handlebars. I learned about the relationships between HTML elements by using handlebars and working with hiding certain elements at different times. This required moving up and then back down from parent elements to children. Additionally I learned how to add click handlers to elements generated after the page has loaded.

User Stories:
1. User wants to create new yoga pose entry to use in class
2. User wants to know what muscle action will happen with that pose
3. User wants to take part of a sequence and copy it for a modified sequence (stretch)
